  <p>This is my assembly / clamping table, inspired by the various other "MFT" tables I combined the best of both t-track and bench-dog holes, purchased steel legs, and added storage cubbies below. Huge thanks to Jerimiah at <a href="http://jeremiahcollection.com/">Jeremiah Collection</a> for doing the CNC fabrication.</p>
