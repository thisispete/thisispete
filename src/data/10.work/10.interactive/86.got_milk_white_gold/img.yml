  Worked with odopod to develop the website for this milk fueled rock legend, part of the 'Got Milk?' campaign. The site featured a interactive music video, as well as my portion; a photo shoot in which you could change the character's costume, and the scenery, snap photos and get the result a custom signed photo downloadable as a desktop image.
