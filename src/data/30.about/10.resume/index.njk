    <h2>Mission</h2>

    <p>I focus on making interactive experiences beyond the desktop. Projects that spark my interest are physical experiences like museum exhibits, point of sale experiences, dedicated UI for hardware, car dashboards, consumer electronics, rapid prototyping, R&D etc. Im very interested in the DIY "make" movement, internet of things, rapid prototyping for product development, and ultimately working with other creatives to create delightful and memorable experiences. I love problem solving, working with design to solve tough UX problems, and feel it’s important to continue to learn and grow while I work, as the work itself grows and evolves around us.</p>
