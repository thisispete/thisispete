  ##This is Pete
  I have a BFA from the New York State School of Ceramics, School of Art and Design at Alfred University. I studied video / sonic / electronic art, graphic design, photography, kinetic sculpture / instillation art, and interactive / web / new media design. 
  
  After school I worked as a web and graphic designer for a company called Coombs Media, most of the work was for Kodak easyshare cameras. While living in rochester I became involved in the western NY art and music scene as a video artist. I primarily showed work at local one-night-only events, and performed video projections for live bands / and sonic artists. I have 2 independent DVD releases of my video work. The first was called systems and was mostly experimental video work from alfred, the second is called 'Rochester Collaborations' which loosely documents my work from NY, showing the collaborations with the sonic artists and musicians from that scene. 
  
  I moved to California in fall of 2004. After getting re-settled I started a regular VJ gig at club Future, and became active in the indie / electro dance scene as a VJ and promoter. All while holding down a day job as an interactive developer. I started out at MRM / McCann doing some work for Microsoft, and then moved to ATTIK where I launched a number of large creative flash websites for Scion cars.
  
  Currently I work at Odopod as a senior developer, making award winning interactive experiences for Nike, Got Milk, Honda, Google, Nest, Tesla, Sony, Nvidia, Nestea etc. I'm still active as a DJ working with Future Universal, and doing Guest DJ spots at Bootie, Nightlife, and other one-off events. I also have been getting back to my electronic artist / kinetic sculpter roots, and have been building several home-made elctronic projects including my antique electronic weather clock.

  My goals for the future are to focus on making interactive experiences beyond the desktop. Projects that get me excited are site specific things such as museum displays, point of purchase, trade show and events booths, public works projects, or dedicated hardware UI for everyday appliances (ambient computing).
