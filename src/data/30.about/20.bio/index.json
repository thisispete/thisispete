  "body": "##This is Pete\nI have a BFA from the New York State School of Ceramics, School of Art and Design at Alfred University. I studied video / sonic / electronic art, graphic design, photography, kinetic sculpture / instillation art, and interactive / web / new media design. \n\nAfter school I worked as a web and graphic designer for a company called Coombs Media, most of the work was for Kodak easyshare cameras. While living in rochester I became involved in the western NY art and music scene as a video artist. I primarily showed work at local one-night-only events, and performed video projections for live bands / and sonic artists. I have 2 independent DVD releases of my video work. The first was called systems and was mostly experimental video work from alfred, the second is called 'Rochester Collaborations' which loosely documents my work from NY, showing the collaborations with the sonic artists and musicians from that scene. \n\nI moved to California in fall of 2004. After getting re-settled I started a regular VJ gig at club Future, and became active in the indie / electro dance scene as a VJ and promoter. All while holding down a day job as an interactive developer. I started out at MRM / McCann doing some work for Microsoft, and then moved to ATTIK where I launched a number of large creative flash websites for Scion cars.\n\nCurrently I work at Odopod as a senior developer, making award winning interactive experiences for Nike, Got Milk, Honda, Google, Nest, Tesla, Sony, Nvidia, Nestea etc. I'm still active as a DJ working with Future Universal, and doing Guest DJ spots at Bootie, Nightlife, and other one-off events. I also have been getting back to my electronic artist / kinetic sculpter roots, and have been building several home-made elctronic projects including my antique electronic weather clock.\n\nMy goals for the future are to focus on making interactive experiences beyond the desktop. Projects that get me excited are site specific things such as museum displays, point of purchase, trade show and events booths, public works projects, or dedicated hardware UI for everyday appliances (ambient computing).\n\n##Awards\n\n###Scion xB: Want2BSquare\n* The FWA SOTD\n     \n###Scion xD: Little Deviant\n* The FWA SOTD\n  \n###Honda Customize your Civic Kiosk\n* Communication Arts: 2008 Interactive Annual\n\n###Got Milk?: White Gold is White Gold\n* The FWA SOTD\n* One Show Interactive : Silver\n* FITC Awards: Flash Animation Winner\n\n###Nestea: Liquid Awesomeness\n* The FWA SOTD\n* One Show Interactive: Finalist\n* Cannes Cyber Lions: Finalist\n  \n###NVIDIA: Speak Visual\n* The FWA SOTD\n* Communication Arts: 2010 Interactive Annual\n* Horizon Interactive Awards: Gold Flash\n* One Show Interactive: Silver & Merit Award\n* Webby Awards: Peopleâ€™s Voice Winner\n* FITC Awards: Winner 3d Flash\n* SXSW Web Awards: Winner Motion Graphics\n* .net Awards: Interactive Site of the Year\n\n###Sony: PIIQ Headphones\n* The FWA SOTD\n* Communication Arts: 2011 Interactive Annual\n* W3 Awards: Silver\n\n###Sony: Sony Internet TV / Google TV\n* The FWA SOTD\n* Interactive Media Awards: Best in Class - Television\n* One Show Interactive Finalist\n* Webby Awards Honoree\n* The Tomorrow Awards Winter Shortlist\n\n###Tesla Retail Experience\n* HOW Interactive Awards - Kiosk\n\n###Nest\n* AWWWARDS site of the day\n\n\n##Residencies / Visiting Artist\n\n###Visiting Artist Alfred University Video Department, Jan. 2002\nWas asked by the Video faculty to work with Juniors and Seniors to teach them the video processing software \"Image/Ine\".\n\n###Experimental Television Center, Jun 2000\nParticipated in the Summer Student Residency at the Experimental Television Center in Owego NY.\n\n##Curatorships\n\n###Equipped, May 2004\nOne Night Show of Video Instillations and Electronic Music at the Visual Studies Workshop in Rochester NY included 6 video artists and 3 live acts of music plus dj's.\n\n###Co-curator Prominence, 2000 & 2001\nAnnual collection of student video works from western New York.
