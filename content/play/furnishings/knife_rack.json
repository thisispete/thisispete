  "description": "<p>This chunk of wood started out as a bleacher seat at the old Cal stadium in Berkeley. It was then used by the Wooden Duck, a local re-claimed wood furniture store, as a finish sample. When they went out of business I acquired it and turned it into a knife rack by milling out spaces in the back to embed magnets.</p>",
