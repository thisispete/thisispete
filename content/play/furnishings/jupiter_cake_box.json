  "description": "<p>Made this cake box and platter set for Ms. Presley. It takes a 9\" or 10\" springform cake, and fits either the glass dome or the matching travel box lid. The wood is quarter sawn sycamore, after a few prototypes I cut out the parts on the CNC, and then bent the kerf cut box sides by first soaking in water. And the red elastic strap holds it all together.</p>",
