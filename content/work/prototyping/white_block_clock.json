This way it stores a 2-d array of 1’s and 0’s for on and off as a 1-d array of integers, which saves memory.</p><p>To create the custom display graphics, first I made some interactive prototypes of the grid of pixels. I whipped up a couple of flash programs that let me click pixels on and off and export the data in a format that the Arduino code would use to display my custom designed numbers. After I was pretty happy with the designs I exported all the data to the Arduino.</p><p><br></p>"
