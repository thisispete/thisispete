The weather service I was using reports something like 40 different weather conditions, so I had to condense the list, and I ended up with 14 ‘conditions’</p><ul><li><p>Cold</p></li><li><p>Hot</p></li><li><p>Fog</p></li><li><p>Cloudy</p></li><li><p>Partly Cloudy</p></li><li><p>Sunny</p></li><li><p>Clear Night</p></li><li><p>Rain</p></li><li><p>Icy Conditions</p></li><li><p>Snow</p></li><li><p>Windy</p></li><li><p>Thunderstorms</p></li><li><p>Severe Weather Warning</p></li><li><p>Dead Clock (no internet connection / error)</p></li></ul>"

I off-loaded the logic to run on a web app, so I can change the zip-code or weather service without re-flashing the firmware.
