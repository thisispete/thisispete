  "description": "<p>Prototype for Twitter, ambient display device that reacts to tweeted keywords by changing colors of a Lifx Tile LED matrix. I was responsible for the industrial design, prototype fabrication, UX design, and full-stack web app development for the admin pages using the Twitter and Lifx apis, and UI components from twitter's in-house framework. Later I also coded a virtualized version using three.js to match a given design direction.</p>",
